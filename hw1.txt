4. 답이 안나오는데, 잘 모르겠습니다

SELECT E.officeCode
FROM classicmodels.customers C, classicmodels.employees E
WHERE E.employeeNumber= C.salesRepEmployeeNumber

5. 답이 아닙니다
SELECT *
FROM classicmodels.customers C,(select extract(year from P.paymentDate)=2004) as P classicmodels.orderdetails D
WHERE C.customerNumber = P.customerNumber
GROUP BY C.customerNumber
HAVING sum(P.amount) = (SELECT max(cnt) FROM (SELECT sum(amount) as cnt FROM classicmodels.payments GROUP BY customerNumber)as tmp);
